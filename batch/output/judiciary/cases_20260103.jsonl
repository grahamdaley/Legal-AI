Directions for hearing were sought and given on 29\nth\nJuly after, if I may say so, some hesitation by the Court on the face of the papers before it. However, those applying for the directions indicated, correctly, that the Court had no discretion in the matter, and the case was duly set down for hearing. This argument, which took place with the assistance of Counsel, spanned two days in mid November 1997. This, then, is the judgment consequent upon that argument.\nTHE FACTS\n2.\nThe Plaintiff's claim herein arises from a misdelivery of goods which had been shipped from China via Hong Kong to Brazil. Mr Kerr, who appeared on behalf of the Defendant in this application, opened the case by presenting the factual position, and in this regard he will, I hope, permit quotation directly from his skeleton argument:\n\"The Defendant issued a bill of lading for shipment of goods from Zhangjiang to Santos on 8\nth\nOctober 1995. The goods were shipped via Hong Kong to Santos and the Defendant subcontracted the voyage to another forwarder who in turn subcontracted the voyage to Mitsui Line. The cargo was carried aboard the \"Nedlloyd Van Nassau\" and arrived in Santos, Brazil on 22\nnd\nNovember 1995. On 23\nrd\nNovember 1995, the goods were transported by lorry to Colombia Bonded Warehouse (a customs warehouse) approximately eight kilometres away from the place of discharge. The vessel on which the cargo was carried left Santos on 25\nth\nNovember 1995. The goods were de-stuffed in Colombia Bonded Warehouse on 28th November 1995. The goods were transferred on 19\nth\nDecember to another customs warehouse on 19th December 1995. This warehouse is 160 kilometres from Santos. On 20\nth\nDecember 1995, the goods were released to a company called Impax Commercial Ltd without production of the Defendant's original bill. Unsurprisingly the Plaintiff's claim is for misdelivery of the goods and the claim amounts to US$70,000.\"\nTHE ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\n3.\nAgainst this background, the Plaintiff asks for determination of the following issues:\n4.\nFirst, whether the Defendant can rely upon the nine month contractual limitation period contained in Clause 6(4)(G) of the Defendant's Bill of Lading and whether the Plaintiff's claim is time-barred? In this connection, I note that the precise wording of the contractual time-bar reads as follows:\n\"The Carrier shall be discharged of all liability unless suit is brought in the proper forum and written notice thereof received by the Carrier within nine months after delivery of the Goods or the date when the Goods should have been delivered. In the event that such time period shall be found contrary to any convention or law compulsorily applicable, the period prescribed by such convention or law shall then apply but in that circumstance only.\"\n5.\nThe second issue is whether the\nHague Rules\nor the\nHague-Visby Rules\napplied to the carriage of the goods and, if so, whether the\nRules\ncontinue to apply whilst the goods were in storage notwithstanding Article I(e) of the said\nRules\n?\n6.\nIt followed, said Mr Kerr, that if his clients were able to obtain what he perceived to be the correct answers to these questions, so that the Defendant could indeed rely upon the nine month time bar provision within the Bill of Lading, the further substantial relief to be granted was that the Plaintiff's claim should be dismissed with costs to the Defendant.\n7.\nIn this manner, therefore, summary relief was sought by the Defendant who, as contracting party, had carried the goods across the world, pursuant to the contract of carriage, only to misdeliver them (or to permit such misdelivery), thereby causing the Plaintiff the loss and damage the subject matter of this claim.\nTHE COURSE OF THE HEARING\n8.\nSomewhat unusually I pause at this stage, before going on to an outline of the arguments, to refer to the course of the hearing, and to a ruling made by the Court which, it transpires, is of more than usual significance in the context of this case.\n9.\nTowards the end of the first day's argument, Mr Kerr, on behalf of the Defendant, rose during Mr Coleman's submission to make application for an adjournment. He did so because, he said, he had been proceeding in this application on the basis that no evidential points would be taken by Mr Coleman. Underpinning this belief was, I understand, the content of telephone calls made between Counsel in advance of the hearing.\n10.\nFor his part, Mr Coleman opposed the application. Whilst there had indeed been such telephone calls, Mr Coleman asserted that the Defendant and its advisers could never have been under any assumption that the facts were agreed, and it could not be the case, in eschewing objection to the somewhat odd\nform\nof the evidence, that Mr Coleman was in somewise to be precluded from commenting upon its substance.\n11.\nI do not intend here to condescend to greater detail about this particular argument because a detailed decision upon this adjournment application was delivered by the Court late in the afternoon of the first day, which decision I have now caused to be transcribed and which, for convenience of reference, I annex to this judgment. The content of the decision speaks for itself and, rightly or wrongly, Mr Kerr's application for an adjournment was ultimately refused.\n12.\nAt the start of play on the second day, Mr Kerr did not (in my view rightly) attempt to reopen the adjournment debate, but nevertheless he did submit that it was not open to Mr Coleman, in the circumstances, to take evidential points in opposition to the Order 14A application. I took this to be an application that Mr Coleman should be ordered to confine himself to purely legal argument, and I refused so to order. Thereafter Mr Kerr adopted the stance that, in any event, his evidence was in fact sufficient for his purpose, and argument on the application was concluded on this basis.\nTHE ARGUMENT\n13.\nMr Kerr submitted that it was the Defendant's case that once the goods underwent a road carriage and were placed into storage, the\nHague\nor the\nHague-Visby Rules\nceased to operate and the Defendant could therefore rely upon the nine month time-bar provision in their Bill of Lading. This was distinct from the one year time-bar within the\nHague-Visby Rules,\nwhich, if operative, it was accepted by both sides would\nnot\nserve to constitute such time-bar in this particular claim.\n14.\nErgo, the real issue of law in this case, said Mr Kerr, was when did the\nRules\ncease to apply, or, alternatively, did they apply right up to the time of delivery? If the latter position prevailed, of course, the Plaintiff would be able to rely upon the provision in the\nRules\nwhich served to render void (by reason of inconsistency with the\nRules\n) the nine month time limit within the Bill of Lading. Whether the\nRules\ncontinued after discharge, submitted Mr Kerr, depended upon the interpretation of articles within the\nRules\n, in particular, Article I(e), Article II and Article VII; and it was the Defendant's primary position in relation to the interpretation of these Articles that the\nRules\nclearly applied\nup to the point of discharge\n, but that thereafter, as for example, being placed into storage, the\nRules\nceased to apply. This was because, once in storage, the contract of carriage of goods by sea had been completed and discharge, in all senses, completed. Most surprisingly, said Mr Kerr, whilst there were a significant number of authorities in this general area, there was no authority where (as here) a land carriage had actually taken place\nafter\ndischarge.\n15.\nIn this connection, I have had the significant advantage, from both sides of the Bar table, of an informed and critical survey of the leading cases in this area, with reference to established authority, both in England and Hong Kong. I do not intend, at this stage, to go into extensive detail in terms of the case law to which reference was made. Suffice to say that the gravamen of Mr Kerr's submission was that the correct approach clearly pointed to a cessation of the application of the\nRules\nupon discharge, and that on the facts of this case there could be no real argument that discharge had not been completed. In this regard, Mr Kerr drew my attention to conflicting\nobiter dicta\nin two Hong Kong decisions; first, that of Liu J.A. in\nWily Products Company Limited v. Hecny Shipping Limited\n[1995] 3 HKC 47 wherein the learned Justice of Appeal stated the position as follows (at 52G-H):\n\"... In other words, despite art I(e), the period of 'carriage of goods' by sea envisaged in art II should not be strictly construed, limiting it to 'events arising from loading to discharge'. Article II would therefore extend the period beyond discharge. In the situation the parties faced, art II is quite capable of standing on its own. The sea carriage did not therefore terminate after discharge and the Hague-Visby Rules still applied at the time of loss before the goods were handed over to the land carrier...\"\n16.\nAnd second, the view of Ching J.A. in\nComputronics International (a firm) v.\nPiff Shipping Limited\nCivil Appeal No. 109 of 1996, wherein the learned Judge stated (at p. 13F-R):-\n\"Our attention was drawn to the decision of another division of this Court in\nWily Products Co. Ltd. v. Hecny Shipping Ltd\n. (1995) 3 HKC 47 per Liu J.A. The other two members of the Court proceeded on the basis that there was no relevant limitation period which could assist the Defendant. Liu, J.A., however, held that 'carriage of goods' as defined in paragraph 1(e) of Article I of the Rules should not be strictly construed. That article defines 'carriage of goods' as covering\n'the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.'\n17.\nArticle II then provides that\n'Subject to the provisions of Article VI, under every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to the loading, handling, storage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth.'\nLiu, J.A., relied upon a decision in the Australian case of\nThe Zhi Jiang Kou\n(1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep.493 wherein it was observed that the words 'custody and care' are apt to include events after discharge and until delivery. We are not at all convinced that that is correct. There is, in our view, a strong argument that the goods were not under a 'contract of carriage' at the time of any misdelivery. ...\"\n18.\nOn general principles, submitted Mr Kerr, and in light of the language and purport of the\nRules\n, the view expressed by Ching J.A. was to be preferred. And that the case of\nWily Products\n,\nop.cit\n., was of no assistance to the Plaintiff as clearly the learned Judge was there dealing with a situation where a land carriage had not taken place.\n19.\nAs might be expected, Mr Coleman for the Plaintiff, the unpaid seller of the misdelivered cargo of bearings, took a strong opposite tack. I think it fair to observe that, to an extent at least, his argument developed during the application itself, possibly (and as sometimes happens) by reason of the forensic focus bought to bear on the problem during the hearing. Be that as it may. Looked at in the round, his propositions, I think, boiled down to the following:-\n20.\nFirst, the Defendant's position that the Rules applied up to discharge, but not once the goods are placed into storage, ignored a significant part of the essence of the contract of carriage, and the suggestion that\nif\na bill of lading holder was not ready at the ship's side to present the bill as the goods were swung over the ship's rail, with the necessary implication that there was thereby an acceptance of all risks accruing from necessary storage, this was also contrary to the essence of the contract.\n21.\nIt followed that\nsecond,\nit was not too wide a meaning to be attributed to the words \"custody and care\" for the\nRules\nto apply to the whole period the goods were under the control of the contracted carrier. The\nRules\nthemselves are not expressed in temporal or indeed geographical terms, but apply to the whole of the contract between shipper and carrier. And as the carrier's contractual obligations included those of bailee, up to and including the time of delivery, the Rules have a corresponding reach. The correct approach, therefore, was that the\nRules\ndid\nnot\ncome to an end upon discharge, there being obligations under the contract going beyond such discharge from the vessel.\n22.\nIn this connection, Mr Coleman submitted that the views of Liu J.A. in\nWily\n,\nop.cit.,\nwere more in tune with the scope and purpose of the\nRules,\nrelying, as the learned Judge there did, upon the judgment of a powerful Court in the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in\nThe \"Zhi Jiang Kou\"\n[1991] 1 Lloyds Rep 493. Indeed, the\nreductio\nof the Defendant's argument, said Mr Coleman, even taking the present facts at face value, was that the carrier would be absolved of responsibility under the\nRules\nif the cargo had been discharged from the vessel straight into a truck which happened to carry them across land, notwithstanding that no bill of lading had ever been presented.\n23.\nThere was, moreover, no suggestion that the Plaintiff in this case had intended or anticipated that the goods might be discharged, stored, de-stuffed and taken to places at any distance from the discharge port, and, said Mr Coleman, it was difficult to see why the Defendant in this case should be exonerated from blame simply because it chose to subcontract the voyage to someone who chose to subcontract it further.\n24.\nThird (and it is here, I think, that Mr Coleman's argument began to develop in the manner that stimulated Mr Kerr's adjournment application), such an important and far-reaching matter of legal principle should not be determined against a factual matrix which was, in substance, less than specific in certain key areas, and therefore far from satisfactory. Whilst Mr Coleman made it clear that his client was in no position to put up a contradictory factual case, he maintained (correctly in my view) his right to comment upon the evidence underpinning the present application, a right which he was certain had not at any stage been abandoned. In this connection, he asked the following rhetorical question:\nWhen, on the evidence, did the misdelivery take place, and when, on the evidence, was the discharge completed?\n25.\nTo some extent, he said, these issues were interlinked. On Mr Kerr's version of events, it was indeed amazing how far in purely physical terms the goods had got without production of the Bill of Lading. Perhaps the answer was that they had been effectively lost when they went over the rail (so that, for example, the crucial mistake occurred relatively early in the piece) or that the discharge operation continued for some time all the way to the warehouse, so that, perhaps, misdelivery had taken place at the time when, and at a place where, one might have expected due delivery to have been taken, although in this latter connection he made the further point that we do not currently know when, on any argument, the goods should have been delivered.\n26.\nIn summary, there was nothing in the evidence about to whom or by what instrument delivery was given off the vessel, nor was there any evidence with regard to what was the document against which the goods were discharged, and put out of the hands of the carrier. This latter information, he said, would not be known until the relevant evidence was produced. Moreover, in terms of container traffic, the issue of the discharge of goods is highly moot - does it, for example, take place on a truck by the quay, or later; and if so, when? In this connection, in his submissions Mr Kerr was seeking to draw a line on a temporal and geographical basis which was incorrect in itself, quite apart from the wider issue of the summary determination of the point.\n27.\nAt the end of the day, therefore, the issue under debate was demonstrably \"fact sensitive\". In addition to the foregoing objections, submitted Mr Coleman (and he asserted his right to take this point if compelled so to do, although he did\nnot\ntake the point about the unconventional form in which the evidence was presented), the evidence before the Court clearly fell foul of the provisions of\nOrder 41 rule 5(2)\nin that the material contained matters clearly not within the deponent's own knowledge, and was patently heavily dependent on hearsay and documentary inference. The point is made good, in this connection, at White Book MN 14A/1-2/8 which reads as follows:-\n\"The summons should be supported by affidavit evidence deposing to all the material facts relating to the questions of law or construction to be determined by the Court For the purposes of O.41, r.5(2), proceedings under Order 14A are not interlocutory proceedings, since by its nature, the application will decide the rights of the parties and will terminate the action or otherwise finally dispose of it ... and therefore, the affidavits for use in proceedings under O.14A may depose only to such facts as the deponent is able of his own knowledge to prove (O.41, r.5(1)).\"\n28.\nI am bound to say that on this latter issue I am in agreement with Mr Coleman. As I observed in my decision refusing the application for the adjournment, it seems to me to be axiomatic, if an Order 14A application is going to be mounted, that the evidence therein be beyond dispute and criticism. In suitable situations, undoubtedly, the Court should not shrink from deciding difficult questions upon an Order 14A application : see, for example, the comments of Leggatt L.J. In the English Court of Appeal decision of\nKorso Finance Establishment Anstalt v. John Wedge and others (1994) unrep.\nin which case the Court of Appeal did not hesitate to construe a letter of agreement.\n29.\nKorso is cited with approval by the learned editors of the White Book at 14A/1-2/4; I note further from the commentary, at 14A/1-2/5 in particular, the observation of Sir Thomas Bingham relating to fact sensitivity, and also the necessity as to the avoidance of any decision which would have the result of rendering a decision in hypothetical terms, the learned editors specifically stating in this context:\n\"Where the issues of fact are interwoven with the legal issues raised, it will be undesirable for the Court to split the legal and factual determination, for to do so would in effect be to give legal rulings in\nvacuo\nor on a hypothetical ruling, which the Court will not do (see\nper\nTaylor L.J. in\nState Bank of India v. Murjani Marketing\n, March 1, 1991, C.A. transcript 91/0304).\"\n30.\nIn this case, the latter observation is particularly salient. However tempting it may be for the Court, in the face of absorbing legal argument, to pontificate upon the precise ambit of the\nHague-Visby Rules\n, in the present circumstances I decline such invitation. I regret that I am not satisfied that there is sufficient evidence before me to do so properly or appropriately, notwithstanding Mr Kerr's persuasive efforts to the contrary. Mr Coleman is correct, I think, in his exposure of relevant\nlacunae\nin the evidence, and for that reason, and also by reason of non-compliance with\nOrder 41 rule 5(2),\nin my judgment this application must fail.\n31.\nI would add at this stage that, as a result of the erudite legal argument upon the ambit of the\nRules,\nI have indeed formed some preliminary views, but I am disinclined to go further at this point. Indeed, I think it would be inappropriate to do so, nor even to provide a general indication as to the broad nature of those views, because it occurs to me that even slight changes to the factual matrix may alter one's perception of the true position. In this case, for example, I am told that the port of Santos has a very large container port within it called Columbia; and against this broad factual background, it is not easy to define the precise meaning of the terms \"discharge and delivery\" in Santos itself.\n32.\nI would also note, as a postscript, that although the case was conducted by Mr Kerr on the basis that, in terms of discharge, one can draw a line in the sand at the latest when the goods happened to be put in a truck for land transportation --- and that the posited facts therefore constituted an\na fortiori\nsituation --- I remain far from certain whether, in any event, this case is susceptible to being boiled down quite as neatly within the present Order 14A argument as Mr Kerr sought to do. To the contrary. I am by no means sure that the relevant time-bar provision in the Bill of Lading necessarily is applicable in instances of\nmisdelivery,\nas against delivery, as to which distinction see the observations of Gleeson C.J. on the meaning of \"delivery\" in\nThe \"Zhi Jiang Kou\"\nop.cit.\nat 499; and also, possibly on a more general plane, the observations of Clark J. in\n\"The Ines\"\n[1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep 144 at 152. But I say no more. Doubtless further argument will be mounted on this interesting aspect of the case if and when this matter gets to trial.\n33.\nIt follows from the foregoing, therefore, that after fully reviewing the arguments of Counsel and all the material placed before the Court, I have concluded that the application must be dismissed. If such is thought to be necessary, I will hear Counsel more fully on the question of costs. For the moment, however, I will make an order\nnisi\nto the effect that the costs of and occasioned by this application are\nto\nbe to the Plaintiff in any event, such costs to be taxed, if not agreed. The case is certified as fit for Counsel.\n34.\nLastly, it remains only to thank Counsel on both sides for their considerable assistance.\n(William Stone)\nJudge of the Court of First Instance\nRepresentation:\nMr Russell Coleman, instructed by M/s Ho & Chan, for Plaintiff\nMr John Kerr, instructed by M/s Dibb Lupton Alsop, for Defendant", "word_count": 3896, "language": "en", "cited_cases": [], "source_url": "https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_body.jsp?DIS=24024&QS=%2B&TP=JU", "pdf_url": null, "scraped_at": "2026-01-03T11:18:58.107756"}

Judgment was given against the Defendants in the sums of $89,085.10 and $42,238.93. The 2nd Defendant now appeals against that judgment. No appeal has been filed by the 1st Defendant.\n2.\nThe Notice of Appeal was filed on 5th December. That was one day late. In addition, it was not served on the Plaintiff's solicitors until 23rd December. That was 12 days late. The reason for the delay in filing the Notice of Appeal was because the 2nd Defendant's director who was handling the case wrongly assumed that Saturday was not a working day. The reason for the delay in\nserving\nthe Notice of Appeal was because he was out of Hong Kong for part of the relevant period. However, no prejudice has been caused to the Plaintiff by the failure to file and serve the Notice of Appeal within the time limits laid down by Ord. 58 r. 1, and I propose to extend the 2nd Defendant's time for filing and serving it.\n3.\nSave for one issue, the facts are not in dispute. The Plaintiff is an international freight forwarder. In April 1995, it agreed to arrange the carriage by air from Hong Kong to Rome of a consignment of men's shirts. The shirts were duly sent to Rome, but no-one took delivery of them. The sums which the Plaintiff was given judgment for represented (a) the Plaintiff's freight charges, and (b) the handling and storage charges which the Plaintiff had to pay.\n4.\nThe one outstanding issue relates to whether the Plaintiff contracted with the 2nd Defendant as well as the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff relies on the fact that, although the shipping instructions and the airway bill were both issued by the 1st Defendant, they both named the 2nd Defendant as the shipper. That is not in dispute. What the 2nd Defendant claims is that the 1st Defendant was in fact the shipper: the 2nd Defendant simply allowed the 1st Defendant to export the consignment in the name of the 2nd Defendant, since the 2nd Defendant was the quota holder, and the licence for the export of the consignment therefore had to be in its name. On the 2nd Defendant's case, therefore, the consignment was exported in the 2nd Defendant's name (even though the 1st Defendant was the actual shipper) in order to conceal the fact that the consignment was being exported by an exporter who was not entitled to export it. These facts are asserted in the 2nd Defendant's Defence. They have not been verified on affidavit or affirmation. Indeed, no evidence has been filed by the 2nd Defendant at all.\n5.\nIn my view, the 2nd Defendant has no defence to the Plaintiff's claim. I say that for two reasons. The first is procedural. Ord. 14 r. 3(1) puts the burden of satisfying the court that there is an issue to be tried on the defendant. This is not one of those rare cases (referred to by Kaplan, J. in\nChinakong Manufactory Ltd. v. Uniden Hong Kong Ltd.\n[1993] 1 HKLR 28 at p.32) in which a verifying affidavit or affirmation is not required. There being no evidence to support the 2nd Defendant's contention, the 2nd Defendant has not satisfied me that there is an issue to be tried.\n6.\nHowever, I would be unhappy about dismissing an appeal on the grounds of procedural default when an appellant is not legally represented. I have therefore considered whether, if there had been an affidavit verifying the facts pleaded in the 2nd Defendant's defence, those facts would have amounted to a defence in law. I do not think that they would have amounted to a defence in law, and that is the principal reason why I dismiss this appeal. Once the 2nd Defendant allowed the 1st Defendant to\nexport\nthe consignment in the name of the 2nd Defendant, the 2nd Defendant must be treated as having authorised the 1st Defendant to ship the consignment in the name of the 2nd Defendant. And once the 2nd Defendant is treated as having authorised the 1st Defendant to\nship\nthe consignment in the name of the 2nd Defendant, the 2nd Defendant must be treated as having been a party to the contract on the footing that the 1st Defendant entered into the contract on behalf of the 2nd Defendant in order to effect the shipment for the consignment in the 2nd Defendant's name.\n7.\nThe fact that the Plaintiff had obtained judgment against the 1st Defendant is not inconsistent with its case that the 1st Defendant acted as agent for the 2nd Defendant. That is because the 1st Defendant was, in addition, a principal in its own right - either because it was the shipper itself (albeit jointly with the 2nd Defendant) or because it was acting for another principal, Derby S.R.L., and that agency was undisclosed.\n8.\nFinally, in the course of the hearing I was shown a letter from the 1st Defendant to the 2nd Defendant written in July 1995. It read:\n\"We refer to the meeting with you, we hereby issue your company a letter to prove that you will be no obligation connect with this matter.\"\nThat letter cannot afford the 2nd Defendant a defence to the Plaintiff's claim. What it might do, depending on the circumstances in which the letter was written, is to amount to a contractual promise by the 1st Defendant to indemnify the 2nd Defendant in the event of the Plaintiff enforcing any judgment it obtained against the 2nd Defendant.\n9.\nFor these reasons, I think that Master Cannon was entirely right to enter summary judgment against the 2nd Defendant, and this appeal must be dismissed.\n(Brian Keith)\nJudge of the Court of First Instance\nRepresentation:\nMr. Richard Zimmern, instructed by Messrs.

A statutory demand was served on the Company on 12 September 1997 which remains unpaid. The Petition is based on the statutory demand and asserts that the Company is insolvent and unable to pay its debts.\n2.\nThe Petition came on for hearing on 22 December 1997. It was opposed by the Company and an affirmation was filed by Chan Kueng Un, a director of the Company. The affirmation referred to the fact that the Company has joint ventures with various companies and entities and that if these joint ventures turn out to be successful, they will resolve the Company's financial difficulties. At the hearing on 22 December, I found that the evidence was less than satisfactory and adjourned the hearing for 14 days to enable the Company to file further evidence, in particular, as to any repayment proposals. At the adjourned hearing, I made the winding up order. The reasons appear below.\n3.\nThe debt is not disputed. A short affirmation was filed by Chan Yok King, the manageress of the Company prior to the adjourned hearing but no concrete proposals were made for the repayment of the debt. Apart from adducing evidence that it had obtained credit facilities of US$1 million from Fook Tai Credits Limited, it was asserted that Fook Tai had no objection to the Company settling the outstanding debt by instalments out of profits to be made by the Company under a joint venture agreement. A further affirmation prepared for the hearing fixed for 7 January of the Company's application to stay execution of the judgment debt was also put before the Court. That affirmation is in substance the same as that filed by Chan Kueng Un to oppose the Petition save that it contains a proposal that the judgment debt be repaid by 60 equal monthly instalments.\n4.\nIt is the Company's contention that in the exercise of the court's discretion, the court ought not make a winding-up order. A more unmeritorious submission in the circumstances is difficult to envisage. The Company's proposal is not that monies to be obtained under the credit facilities are to be applied to discharge the debt. Even if that had been the case (which it is not), it is difficult to see why it would be fair and just to exercise my discretion in such a way as to require the judgment creditor to be repaid over a period of five years. On the evidence as filed, the proposal simply is that if the Company enters into the joint venture (and it is by no means certain that it has been selected to be the joint venture partner in the project in Indonesia), the debt is to be repaid out of profits to be earned. Such profits of course have not materialised and may never materialise. The credit facilities obtained are to be applied towards the joint venture rather than for the repayment of the debt.\n5.\nIn all the circumstances of this case, there is no valid reason not to make the winding-up order to which the judgment creditor, whose debt is not disputed, has a\nprima facie\nright.\nRepresentation:\nMr Shum Ka Hei, inst'd by M/s Barlow Lyde & Gilbert, for Petitioner\nMr Lawrence Yip, inst'd by M/s Wong & Partners, for Respondent\nMiss McKenna for Official Receiver\n(Doreen Le Pichon)\nJudge of the High Court Court of First Instance", "word_count": 672, "language": "en", "cited_cases": [], "source_url": "https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_body.jsp?DIS=17758&QS=%2B&TP=JU", "pdf_url": null, "scraped_at": "2026-01-03T11:19:13.450819"}

The Second Petition was filed on 30 December 1997 and a summons for directions therein, also issued on that date, came on for hearing immediately after the hearing of the First Petition. Upon the hearing of the summons for directions, the Second Petition was ordered to be placed in the List for hearing on 12 January 1998.\n3.\nCLP and Holdings, being the Petitioners in respectively the First Petition and the Second Petition, were represented by the same leading counsel. Because of the interlinking of the Petitions, submissions made in the First Petition extended to aspects of the Second Petition.\n4.\nThe First and Second Petitions came on for hearing on 5 and 12 January 1998 respectively. Neither was opposed.\n5.\nAt the hearing of the First Petition, I granted the relief sought under section 166 of the\nCompanies Ordinance\nand sanctioned the Scheme and confirmed the reduction of capital which it involved. At the hearing of the Second Petition, I confirmed the reduction of the share premium account of Holdings. Since the Second Petition is in a sense part of the Scheme, the reasons for sanctioning the Scheme and confirming the reductions of capital of CLP and Holdings are dealt with, compositely, below.\nThe First Petition\nThe Scheme\n6.\nIn essence, the Scheme seeks to superimpose a holding company, namely Holdings, above CLP. The mechanism to achieve that has the following features :\n(i) the reduction of the capital of CLP by the cancellation of all its issued shares (\"the Scheme Shares\") on the Effective Date;\n(ii) subject to such reduction of capital taking effect, the increase of the authorised share capital of CLP to its former amount of $13.75 billion by the creation of such number of new CLP shares as is equal to the number of Scheme Shares cancelled;\n(iii) CLP to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings on the Effective Date by applying the credit arising through the reduction of capital in paying up in full at par the new CLP shares to be allotted and issued to Holdings or its nominees; and\n(iv) holders of Scheme Shares to receive one share in Holdings for every Scheme Share held.\nCLP would thus become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and CLP shareholders would become shareholders of Holdings.\n7.\nSchemes involving this type of mechanism is not uncommon : see\nRe National Bank Limited\n[1966] 1 WLR 819 at 823C-F.\n8.\nPursuant to an Order of the Court dated 17 November 1997, a meeting of the shareholders of CLP was convened and held on 15 December 1997 for the purpose of considering and forthwith approving the Scheme. The meeting was duly convened and the resolution that the Scheme be approved without modification was duly passed. Of a total of 234 members present in person or by proxy, representing 1,364,232,049 shares, only two members holding 161,549 shares voted against the resolution. So at the meeting 99.988% of the votes cast were in favour of the resolution. This represented 54.82% of the issued share capital.\nReasons for the Scheme\n9.\nThese are explained in the second section of the Chairman's letter to CLP shareholders. The letter states that the business activities of CLP fall broadly into two categories. The first category is the core electricity-related activities in Hong Kong which are governed by the Scheme of Control (\"SoC\") Agreement with the Hong Kong Government governing the financial operations of CLP and the Castle Peak Power Company Limited (\"CAPCO\") in which CLP holds a 40% interest insofar as they related to electricity-related activities in Hong Kong. Under the SoC, CLP and CAPCO are obligated to supply adequate and reliable supplies of electricity to customers at the lowest reasonable cost. Tariffs chargeable are designed to recover operating costs but the annual return is suggested at 13.5% of CLP's and CAPCO's average net fixed assets relating to the electricity business in Hong Kong plus 1.5% on net fixed assets financed by shareholders' investments and acquired after September 1978. The second category comprises the CLP Group's electricity-related activities outside of the SoC, including power projects in China and other countries as well as the development of CLP's properties that are no longer required for electricity-related activities.\n10.\nThe directors consider that a re-organisation will address the different characteristics of the SoC and non-SoC business as the latter has been growing, particularly in recent years. Other utility companies in Hong Kong have also introduced holding company structures in line with practices in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The Chairman's letter went on to say as follows -\n\" The Directors believe that the Group Reorganisation will bring considerable benefits to the CLP Group. In particular, it will:\n(i) provide a clear delineation between the SoC business and non-SoC business, resulting in a better understanding of the overall business by investors and customers;\n(ii) enable CLP Holdings to develop its non-SoC business in a number of areas, including power projects in China and elsewhere, as well as property development, separately from the SoC business;\n(iii) further develop distinct management teams dedicated to the SoC business and non-SoC business; and\n(iv) provide CLP Holdings with increased flexibility to invest its cash resources, including the funds received from the share placement to CITIC Pacific completed in March 1997, and raise finance for projects undertaken in the non-SoC business.\"\n11.\nThe pre and post reorganisation corporate structure is illustrated by means of a chart which is unnecessary to reproduce here. In brief, Holdings is to acquire all of the non-SoC business from CLP with the exception of CLP's 49% interest in Hong Kong Pump Storage Development Company Limited (\"PSDC\"), an associated company of CLP at book value. CLP will retain its SoC business which will include its 40% interest in CAPCO and its investment in PSDC which has the right to use certain pump storage capacity of the Guangzhou Pump Storage Power Station until 2034. The existence of various agreements prevents PSDC from becoming a subsidiary of Holdings.\nOverseas shareholders\n12.\nClause 4 of the Scheme provides that where the directors of CLP are advised that the allotment and issue, or transfer, of Holdings' shares to a holder of Scheme Shares may be prohibited by any relevant law or so prohibited except after compliance with conditions regarded by the directors of Holdings or CLP regarded as unduly onerous, then such shares in Holdings are to be sold and the net proceeds accounted for to the holder of Scheme Shares in full satisfaction of his rights to Holdings' shares which he would otherwise have become entitled under the Scheme. So, where such advice is received in relation to any particular overseas jurisdiction, the shareholders resident there will be forced to have their shares in Holdings sold. Although it may be open to shareholders whose shares are compulsorily sold to immediately repurchase Holdings' shares with the net proceeds, such a course may have limited appeal at this particular juncture, given the financial crisis affecting Southeast Asia in particular and the volatility of the stock market world-wide. Moreover the transaction costs will have to be borne by these shareholders.\n13.\nThere is evidence that as at 19 September 1997, CLP had shareholders resident in 25 overseas jurisdictions. Advice was not obtained from jurisdictions in respect of every jurisdiction in which the shareholders were resident. The jurisdictions deemed material were Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and U.S.A., a determination made by the directors of CLP by reference both to the aggregate number of shareholders resident in them and in terms of the perceived level of development of the local securities regulatory framework. Advice was obtained from foreign legal counsel in those material foreign jurisdictions as to whether the allotment of Holdings' shares to shareholders in CLP would require any specific compliance with relevant securities laws or regulations. Having regard to advice taken which is summarized in the affirmation of John Stirling Gale dated 31 December 1997, the net effect is that no overseas shareholder will in fact be affected by Clause 4 of the Scheme. Accordingly, no question arises as to the fairness of the Scheme\nvis-à-vis\noverseas shareholders.\n14.\nIn the course of his submissions, Mr Sykes, Q.C. for CLP, referred to Clause 4 as being for the protection of CLP rather than its shareholders; that it is legitimate protection for a company issuing shares having shareholders in overseas jurisdictions. Even if that be so, it does not follow that the Court is precluded from considering the impact of the provision on overseas shareholders in assessing the overall fairness of the Scheme.\n15.\nSince, in the events that have happened, no overseas shareholders will in fact be affected by Clause 4, because no advice has been received by the directors of Holdings or CLP as provided in that clause, no issue now arises from the operation of Clause 4. Any question that might have arisen has been rendered academic.\nClause 10 of the Scheme\n16.\nIt reads as follows -\n\"10. CLP Holdings shall, prior to the Effective Date, present a petition to the Court for confirmation of the reduction of its share premium account referred to in paragraph (F) of this Scheme pursuant to section 59 of the Companies Ordinance and the holders of CLP Holdings Shares allotted and issued, or transferred, pursuant to Clause 3 of this Scheme shall be deemed, for themselves and their successors in title in relation to such CLP Holdings Shares, to have approved and consented to such reduction of the share premium account of CLP Holdings.\"\nThe presentation of the Second Petition is thus made an integral part of the Scheme. Moreover, CLP shareholders on becoming holders of Holdings' shares pursuant to the Scheme are deemed to have consented to the reduction of Holdings' share premium account.\n17.\nThis provision is the unusual feature of the Scheme. Its\nraison d'etre\nis to address the two technical problems which arise as a result of the creation of a holding company.\n18.\nFirst, the effect of section 48B(2) of Cap.32 is that Holdings is required to create a share premium account because of its acquisition of the issued share capital of CLP under the Scheme. Section 48B(2) reads :\n\" (2) Where shares are issued for a consideration other than cash and the value of the consideration, as estimated by the directors having regard to all relevant information, is in excess of the amount credited as paid up on the shares so issued, the shares shall be deemed to have been issued at a premium equal to the difference between the value so estimated and the amount credited as paid up on the shares so issued.\"\n19.\nThe share premium is the difference between the market value of CLP shares in issue on the Effective Date less the aggregate nominal value of Holdings' shares issued to CLP shareholders under the Scheme. Based on the market value of CLP shares at the close of business on 2 January 1998, the share premium account is of the order of $92 billion. In fact their market value as at 5 January, the day before the Effective Date (at $41.60 per share) was a little less and the share premium account upon the Scheme taking effect came to $91,072,512,000.\n20.\nThe existence of a large share premium account will create a very unsatisfactory consolidated balance sheet for Holdings because of \"goodwill\" arising on consolidation. This is the excess of the value of CLP shares over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired. See\nRe Lippo China Resources Limited\n, 1997, MP 4195 at pp.7-9.\n21.\nIn its balance sheet, Holdings' investment in CLP will have to reflect the market value of the CLP shares. At $41.60 per share, their market value is just over $103.5 billion. As at 30 September 1997, the audited consolidated shareholders' funds of the CLP Group came to $39.297 billion. Between that date and 5 January 1998 (the date preceding the Effective Date), it is estimated that profits of $1.6 billion will have been generated. Therefore, as at the Effective Date, the consolidated shareholders' funds will amount to $40.897 billion. The difference between Holdings' original investment in CLP of approximately $103.5 billion and CLP's net assets represents goodwill on consolidation. Thus the goodwill arising will be approximately $62.6 billion.\n22.\nOne of the purposes of the Second Petition is to eliminate the value of the goodwill so arising against the share premium account of Holdings. As to the practice of eliminating goodwill arising on consolidation, see\nRe Ratners Group plc\n(1988) BCC 293 at 294 and\nRe Lippo China Resources Limited\n(\nsupra\n) at pp.7-9.\n23.\nSecond, Holdings will not be able to treat the profits earned by CLP prior to the acquisition by Holdings as available for distribution by way of dividends to Holdings' shareholders. This is the effect of para.18 of Schedule 10 to Cap.32. The relevant provisions read -\n\"18.(4) Where group accounts are not submitted, there shall be annexed to the balance sheet a statement showing -\n(a) ......\n(b) the net aggregate amount, so far as it concerns members of the holding company and is not dealt with in the company's accounts, of the subsidiaries' profits after deducting the subsidiaries' losses (or vice versa) -\n(i) for the respective financial years of the subsidiaries ending with or during the financial year of the company; and\n(ii) for their previous financial years since they respectively became the holding company's subsidiary;\n(c) the net aggregate amount of the subsidiaries' profits after deducting the subsidiaries' losses (or vice versa) -\n(i) for the respective financial years of the subsidiaries ending with or during the financial year of the company; and\n(ii) for their other financial years since they respectively became the holding company's subsidiary;\nso far as those profits are dealt with, or provision is made for those losses, in the company's accounts;\n(d) ..........\nor, in so far as the information required by this sub-paragraph is not obtainable, a statement that it is not obtainable:\nProvided that the Financial Secretary may, on the application or with the consent of the company's directors, direct that in relation to any subsidiary this sub-paragraph shall not apply or shall apply only to such extent as may be provided by the direction.\n(5) Sub-paragraph (4)(b) and (c) shall apply only to profits and losses of a subsidiary which may properly be treated in the holding company's account as revenue profits or losses, and the profits or losses attributable to any shares in a subsidiary for the time being held by the holding company or any other of its subsidiaries shall not (for that or any other purpose) be treated as aforesaid so far as they are profits or losses for the period before the date on or as from which the shares were acquired by the company or any of its subsidiaries, except that they may in a proper case be so treated where -\n(a) the company is itself the subsidiary of another body corporate; and\n(b) the shares were acquired from that body corporate or a subsidiary of it;\nand for the purpose of determining whether any profits or losses are to be treated as profits or losses for the said period the profit or loss for any financial year of the subsidiary may, if it is not practicable to apportion it with reasonable accuracy by reference to the facts, be treated as accruing from day to day during that year and be apportioned accordingly.\"\n24.\nEnglish provisions parallel to those of section 48B and para.18(5) of the 10th Schedule to Cap.32 have been held to have that effect. See\nShearer v. Bercain Ltd.\n[1980] 3 All ER 295. On the effect of section 56(1) of the\nCompanies Act 1948\n, being the English counterpart to section 48B(2), Walton J. held (at 311b) -\n\"... on its face s 56(1) clearly envisages a premium arising on an issue of shares otherwise than for cash. In general, it is the duty of the directors to issue shares in their company for the best equivalent they can obtain, and in a very large number of cases that will mean that they will be able to issue them at a premium, and consequently must do so. The amount of the premium must therefore in all cases be a matter of interest and concern to the directors. That being so, there can be no possible ground for the legislature having made such a ludicrous and totally unworkable distinction between cases where there is a stated and cases where there is no stated premium, and distinct from the factual position whether shares have or have not actually been issued at a premium.\"\nThe learned judge summarised the effect in these words (at 311e-f) :\n\"... Shortly put, whatever is purchased with capital in the shape of shares itself, or an equivalent amount, is itself to be treated as capital. That is the intent of s 56, and, in my judgment, it achieves that end.\"\n25.\nThen in dealing with the English counterpart to para.18(5) of the 10th Schedule, the learned Judge remarked (at 311j-312a) -\n\" There is, however, yet another provision in the 1948 Act, somewhat like the celebrated (but apocryphal) provision regarding the marriage of the Town Clerk of Leeds, tucked away in para 15 of Sch 8 to the 1948 Act. Schedule 8 is dealing with accounts, and para 15 is in Part II of the schedule, dealing with the position where the company is a holding or subsidiary company.\"\nAfter setting out the relevant provisions, the learned Judge went on to hold (at 312e-j) :\n\" The question here is simply: are the words 'for ... any other purpose' completely general, or are they limited in some, and if so what, manner? ... [Counsel for the Crown] suggested that 'for ... any other purpose' meant 'for any other purpose in the accounts of the holding company'. Moreover, he submitted that all that sub-para (5) provided was that the profits in question were not to be treated as revenue profits. Be that so: they were still profits, which the company was free to distribute as it thought fit. Finally he submitted that no consistent purpose was to be discerned in those two sub-paragraphs of Sch 8, and that there was no corresponding provision in para 17 of the same schedule.\nTo this last point counsel as amicus curiae retorted unanswerably that para 17 was dealing with consolidated accounts, and that the place to which one had to look to discover whether or not sums were distributable by way of dividend was the holding company's own accounts. He also said that whether the Board of Trade had power to amend Sch 8 or not was immaterial; it had to be construed as it stood. Counsel as amicus curiae further submitted that, although this was indeed an odd place to find a general provision of this nature, there was no doubt at all as to what it did, in terms, provide; and that it cannot possibly have been intended to leave the pre-acquisition profits available for distribution as dividend. What would be the point of a provision which merely robbed them of their character of revenue profits? What conceivable purpose could it serve?\nI agree with counsel as amicus curiae. The words 'for ... any other purpose' are quite general, and I cannot see how they can be confined in any manner to the purposes of the holding company's accounts. I cannot myself envisage anything in particular to which that could refer.\"\n27.\nMr Sykes Q.C. said that these problems were so fundamental that the law was changed not only in England but also in other jurisdictions such as Singapore and New Zealand. But in Hong Kong the law has not been changed.\n28.\nThe problems set out above can be resolved by the reduction of the share premium account. In addition, it will enable Holdings to write off preliminary expenses and the expenses of the Scheme. Whilst capital duty which is a significant proportion of the estimated costs of the Scheme of $370 million can be written off against the share premium account pursuant to section 48B(3)(b)(ii), the balance cannot and will have to be treated as realised losses and must be covered by distributable profits before Holdings can pay a dividend.\n29.\nAs regards the reduction of the share premium account, it is proposed that it be reduced to an amount equivalent to CLP's stated share premium account of $13.708 billion less an amount equivalent to the expenses of the Scheme and other preliminary expenses. The amount becoming available upon such reduction is to be applied :\n(i) to eliminate goodwill on consolidation by writing down the investment of Holdings in CLP so that it is, so far as possible, equal to the book value of the consolidated net assets of CLP as at the Effect Date;\n(ii) to write off the expenses of the Scheme and other preliminary expenses; and\n(iii) to make available the balance as distributable reserves of Holdings.\nThis is set out in the Chairman's letter, the explanatory statement as well as Recital (F) to the Scheme.\n30.\nThe objective, assuming that the reduction of the share premium account is confirmed, is to replicate a balance sheet for Holdings that is substantially the same as that for CLP immediately prior to the Effective Date. Set out below is the pro forma balance sheet for Holdings, using updated figures available at the hearing of the Second Petition :\nHOLDINGS\nPro forma balance sheet\nHK$m\nCapital Employed\nInvestment in subsidiary\n- initial value\n103,514\n- write down\n(62,617)\n40,897\nCurrent assets\n- cash at bank\n325\nCurrent liabilities\n- due to Companies Registry\n(273)\n- due to CLP for costs\n(27)\n(300)\n- due to Belleterre\n(370)\n(670)\n40,552\n======\nShare capital\n12,442\nShare premium\n13,363\nReserves\n- from reduction\n77,709\n- costs expended\n(45)\n- costs accrued\n(300)\n- write down investment in CLP\n(62,617)\n14,747\n40,552\n======\n(Belleterre mentioned above is a company incorporated in the BVI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CLP which advanced $370 million to Holdings on 24 December 1997 principally to cover the capital duty liabilities of Holdings under the Scheme.)\n31.\nWith such a balance sheet for Holdings, the position of CLP immediately before the Scheme and the position of Holdings immediately after the Scheme may be summarised as follows :\nCLP\nHOLDINGS\nShareholders funds @30.9.97\n39,297\n-\nUndistributed profits to 5.1.98\n1,600\n-\nShareholders funds @6.1.98\n40,897\n======\n40,552\n======\nRepresented by\nShare capital\n12,442\n12,442\nShare premium\n13,708\n13,363\nReserves\n@30.9.97\n13,147\nplus to 5.1.98\n1,600\n14,747\n14,747\n40,897\n======\n40,552\n======\nThe Court's functions\nA. Schemes of arrangement\n32.\nThe Court is invited to sanction the Scheme. In\nRe Dorman, Long & Company, Limited\n[1934] Ch.635 Maugham J. held (at p.655) that -\n\"It is plain that the duties of the court are two-fold. The first is to see that the resolutions are passed by the statutory majority in value and number ... at a meeting or meetings duly convened and held. The other duty is in the nature of a discretionary power ...\"\nHe went on to say (at p.657) as follows -\n\"In my opinion, then, so far as the second duty is concerned what I have to see is whether the proposal is such that an intelligent and honest man, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve.\"\n(1) Compliance with statutory requirements\n33.\nAs regards the first ground, there appears to be four separate considerations, namely :\n(i) the classes of members or creditors must be properly constituted;\n(ii) the meetings were duly convened in accordance with the directions given by the court hearing the originating summons;\n(iii) members or creditors have been given a sufficient explanation of the Scheme and its effects and sufficient information to enable them to make a reasonable judgment as to how to vote at the meeting; and\n(iv) the requisite majority (i.e. a simple majority in number representing three quarters in value of those present and voting in person or by proxy at the meeting) has voted in favour of the Scheme.\nSee generally\nBoyle and Marshall on Practice and Procedure of the Companies Court\n(1997 Edn.) at 3.6.6.\n34.\nIn the present case, no issue arises as to the correct composition of the classes of members or creditors since only members holding CLP ordinary shares of $5 each are involved. There is evidence that the requisite meeting was duly convened and passed by the requisite majority.\n35.\nSo far as the third consideration is concerned, \"the extent and quality of the information required to be supplied depends on the facts of each particular case.\" See\nRe Heron International N.V.\n[1994] 1 BCLC 667 at 672i.\n36.\nIn the present case, pared to its essentials, the two Petitions are designed to interpose a holding company which will have a balance sheet akin to that of CLP immediately prior to the implementation of the Scheme. The costs of the Scheme which are not insignificant (estimated to be $370 million) are to be paid out of monies otherwise forming part of distributable reserves. Put shortly, the shareholders are asked to bear the cost of the exercise, since the distributable reserves of Holdings will be less than the distributable reserves of CLP prior to the Group reorganisation, the difference being the expenses of the Scheme and the preliminary expenses. Those matters form the guts of the Scheme.\n37.\nConsent must mean \"informed\" consent. Implicit in this is that all material information be disclosed to the shareholders. The amount of costs attributable to each share or the estimated costs is plainly material information.\n38.\nIt is said that the costs are\nde minimis\n. But whether they are to be so regarded must be a matter for the shareholders who, after all, are to foot the bill for the reorganisation, the ostensible benefit being of a rather intangible kind, namely, the rationalisation of CLP's businesses. Only they are qualified to pass judgment on whether the costs involved, amounting to 10% of the aggregate dividends declared by CLP for the year ended 30 September 1997, are inconsequential.\n39.\nNeither the explanatory statement nor the Scheme itself contained any information about expenses other than that they will be Holdings' liability to be written off against the share premium account. Only in the Chairman's letter is there any reference to the estimated costs of the Scheme (i.e. $370 million) \"equivalent to approximately $0.15 per CLP share\". Had the explanatory statement also contained this information, the costs to be borne by each share would undoubtedly have been more effectively brought home to the shareholders. I say this because the composite document (\"the Circular\") circulated to shareholders, similar to prospectuses and the like may be described as \"heavy\" reading and not readily comprehensible to the uninitiated. Regrettably they are usually notable for length, verbosity and obfuscation rather than for brevity and clarity. The single reference to estimated costs lies buried in the Circular, the English version of which runs to almost 140 pages.\n40.\nThe estimated expenses of $370 million include $49 million which, at the hearing on 5 January, was represented as being the aggregate amount of professional fees but in respect of which no breakdown was provided. Leading counsel submitted that it is not appropriate for the Court to second guess the reasonableness or otherwise of the fees incurred. It was further urged that the duty of scrutinising the reasonableness or otherwise of the level of fees falls upon the directors. But it is not a question of any second guessing on the part of the Court : rather, that information ought to be provided to the shareholders who are paying for the exercise. In my judgment, it is information that would assist a shareholder in determining whether, in the light of all relevant information, to give or withhold his consent. Moreover, it is precisely the absence of any mechanism for independent scrutiny and challenge (such as the taxation procedure) that makes full disclosure so much more important. It would have been different had the directors sought to obtain a general mandate from the shareholders to be the sole arbiters of what fees are reasonable and to incur such fees as they deem appropriate for the purposes of the reorganisation.\n41.\nThere is another respect in which the treatment of costs in the Circular requires comment. At the hearing of the First Petition, the Court's attention was not drawn to the fact that a significant part of the $49 million of fees was a contingency provision. At the hearing of the Second Petition a week later, when the final figures became available, the Court sought an explanation for the apparent decrease in costs from $370 million to $345 million, $3 million of which was attributable to the lower share price. It then emerged that the $49 million included a significant contingency and that this was referred to in the affirmation of Mr Dickson Leach dated 30 December 1997 filed in the Second Petition. As noted above, this was not referred to at the hearing of the First Petition notwithstanding queries raised as to the breakdown of the $49 million.\n42.\nAccording to paragraph 8 of the affirmation, fees as at 30 December were estimated to be $27 million. If so, the contingency would be $22 million. At the hearing of the Second Petition, the Court was provided with a summary showing the amounts forecast and actual liabilities. It showed a contingency of $27 million, estimated fees as at 30 December at $22 million, with actual fees being $27 million. In the light of Mr Dickson Leach's affirmation, it would appear that contrary to what the Court was told by leading counsel on instructions that the fees had increased by $5 million from $22 million to $27 million or 22% in the interim, the more likely scenario is that the entries under the forecast column for \"Fees\" and \"Contingency\" in the summary were erroneously transposed and that there was no change in the amount of fees during that 2 week period.\n43.\nBe that as it may, all this merely reinforces the need for transparency and full disclosure of material information, a practice that can only be salutary. In my judgment, the Circular ought to have disclosed both the fact and the amount of the contingency.\n44.\nWhilst CLP's approach to the costs issue is wrong and there are deficiencies in disclosure in the Circular, in all the circumstances, they are not so fundamental as to justify the withholding of the Court's sanction. The shareholders have not been misled although the information supplied to them left something to be desired. I hasten to add that this should not be taken by future applicants as an invitation to be economic with material information. They do so at their peril.\n(2) Overall merits\n45.\nAs regards the second ground, the initial onus is upon the Applicant to establish the fairness of the Scheme. Much emphasis was put on the fact that it received strong voting support, a fact which may be thought sufficient to raise a strong inference of fairness. Gower has observed with characteristic perspicacity that \"the court cannot readily investigate the indoor management of the company and therefore it tends to take refuge in the facile but fatal rule that\ncreditors or shareholders know best.\" The rule has its origins in\nRe English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank\n(1893) 3 Ch.385 where Lindley L.J. held (at 409) :\n\"If the creditors are acting on sufficient information and with time to consider what they are about, and are acting honestly, they are, I apprehend, much better judges of what is to their commercial advantage than the court can be.\"\nAs Gower noted, the rule \"is based on the fundamentally false assumption that a vote of a meeting necessarily represents the informed opinion of the majority of members of the class concerned unprejudiced by any conflicting interests.\" See\nGower's Principles of Company Law\n4th Edn. at 712-3.\n46.\nBut no question of conflicting interests arises in the present case. Therefore, applying the test laid down in\nRe Dorman, Long\n(\nsupra\n), I am satisfied that the proposal is such that \"an intelligent and honest man ... acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve\". Accordingly, it is appropriate to sanction the Scheme.\nB. Reductions of capital\n47.\nThe applicable principles are set out in my decision in\nRe Lippo China Resources Ltd.\n1997, MP 4195 where the relevant English authorities are reviewed. They are that -\n(i) the shareholders are treated equitably;\n(ii) the reduction proposals are properly explained in the Circular;\n(iii) creditors are safeguarded; and\n(iv) the reduction is for a discernible purpose.\nEach of the four requirements being satisfied, there is therefore no reason not to confirm the reduction of capital which the Scheme involves.\nThe Second Petition\n48.\nSince this also involves a reduction of capital, the principles set out above apply. So far as creditor protection is concerned, Holdings which was only recently incorporated, has no liabilities except liabilities for capital duty and for expenses. The expenses are owed to CLP. As noted above, Belleterre has advanced $370 million to Holdings principally to enable Holdings to discharge its capital duty liabilities. Both Belleterre and CLP have consented to the proposed reduction of Holdings' share premium account and for that purpose, they have agreed to postpone their respective debts. So the only creditor that needs to be protected is the Company Registry for capital duty. For this purpose, an undertaking was given at the stage of the Order on the summons for directions that if a dividend is declared before the Company Registry's debt is discharged, the dividend is to be paid out of funds other than those representing the advance from Belleterre and deposited with the Hongkong Bank.\n49.\nAs to the need for the \"usual full undertaking\" or the\nGrosvenor\ntype of undertaking (considered in\nRe Lippo China Resources Ltd.\nat pp.4-7), I am satisfied that it is not appropriate since there is but one creditor and there is more than sufficient cash to cover that liability.\n50.\nThat the proposed reduction is for a discernible purpose has plainly been established and I need to say no more about this.\n51.\nFor those reasons, it is appropriate to confirm the reduction of the share premium account.\n(Doreen Le Pichon)\nJudge of the Court of First Instance\nHigh Court\nRepresentation:\nMr Richard Sykes, Q.C. leading Mr Winston Poon, S.C., inst'd by M/s Stephenson Harwood & Lo, for CLP Company Limited (MP 3825/97)\nMr Winston Poon, S.C., inst'd by M/s Stephenson Harwood & Lo, for CLP Holdings Limited (MP4519/97)", "word_count": 6084, "language": "en", "cited_cases": [], "source_url": "https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_body.jsp?DIS=17601&QS=%2B&TP=JU", "pdf_url": null, "scraped_at": "2026-01-03T11:19:16.833130"}

The Second Petition was filed on 30 December 1997 and a summons for directions therein, also issued on that date, came on for hearing immediately after the hearing of the First Petition. Upon the hearing of the summons for directions, the Second Petition was ordered to be placed in the List for hearing on 12 January 1998.\n3.\nCLP and Holdings, being the Petitioners in respectively the First Petition and the Second Petition, were represented by the same leading counsel. Because of the interlinking of the Petitions, submissions made in the First Petition extended to aspects of the Second Petition.\n4.\nThe First and Second Petitions came on for hearing on 5 and 12 January 1998 respectively. Neither was opposed.\n5.\nAt the hearing of the First Petition, I granted the relief sought under section 166 of the\nCompanies Ordinance\nand sanctioned the Scheme and confirmed the reduction of capital which it involved. At the hearing of the Second Petition, I confirmed the reduction of the share premium account of Holdings. Since the Second Petition is in a sense part of the Scheme, the reasons for sanctioning the Scheme and confirming the reductions of capital of CLP and Holdings are dealt with, compositely, below.\nThe First Petition\nThe Scheme\n6.\nIn essence, the Scheme seeks to superimpose a holding company, namely Holdings, above CLP. The mechanism to achieve that has the following features :\n(i) the reduction of the capital of CLP by the cancellation of all its issued shares (\"the Scheme Shares\") on the Effective Date;\n(ii) subject to such reduction of capital taking effect, the increase of the authorised share capital of CLP to its former amount of $13.75 billion by the creation of such number of new CLP shares as is equal to the number of Scheme Shares cancelled;\n(iii) CLP to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings on the Effective Date by applying the credit arising through the reduction of capital in paying up in full at par the new CLP shares to be allotted and issued to Holdings or its nominees; and\n(iv) holders of Scheme Shares to receive one share in Holdings for every Scheme Share held.\nCLP would thus become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and CLP shareholders would become shareholders of Holdings.\n7.\nSchemes involving this type of mechanism is not uncommon : see\nRe National Bank Limited\n[1966] 1 WLR 819 at 823C-F.\n8.\nPursuant to an Order of the Court dated 17 November 1997, a meeting of the shareholders of CLP was convened and held on 15 December 1997 for the purpose of considering and forthwith approving the Scheme. The meeting was duly convened and the resolution that the Scheme be approved without modification was duly passed. Of a total of 234 members present in person or by proxy, representing 1,364,232,049 shares, only two members holding 161,549 shares voted against the resolution. So at the meeting 99.988% of the votes cast were in favour of the resolution. This represented 54.82% of the issued share capital.\nReasons for the Scheme\n9.\nThese are explained in the second section of the Chairman's letter to CLP shareholders. The letter states that the business activities of CLP fall broadly into two categories. The first category is the core electricity-related activities in Hong Kong which are governed by the Scheme of Control (\"SoC\") Agreement with the Hong Kong Government governing the financial operations of CLP and the Castle Peak Power Company Limited (\"CAPCO\") in which CLP holds a 40% interest insofar as they related to electricity-related activities in Hong Kong. Under the SoC, CLP and CAPCO are obligated to supply adequate and reliable supplies of electricity to customers at the lowest reasonable cost. Tariffs chargeable are designed to recover operating costs but the annual return is suggested at 13.5% of CLP's and CAPCO's average net fixed assets relating to the electricity business in Hong Kong plus 1.5% on net fixed assets financed by shareholders' investments and acquired after September 1978. The second category comprises the CLP Group's electricity-related activities outside of the SoC, including power projects in China and other countries as well as the development of CLP's properties that are no longer required for electricity-related activities.\n10.\nThe directors consider that a re-organisation will address the different characteristics of the SoC and non-SoC business as the latter has been growing, particularly in recent years. Other utility companies in Hong Kong have also introduced holding company structures in line with practices in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The Chairman's letter went on to say as follows -\n\" The Directors believe that the Group Reorganisation will bring considerable benefits to the CLP Group. In particular, it will:\n(i) provide a clear delineation between the SoC business and non-SoC business, resulting in a better understanding of the overall business by investors and customers;\n(ii) enable CLP Holdings to develop its non-SoC business in a number of areas, including power projects in China and elsewhere, as well as property development, separately from the SoC business;\n(iii) further develop distinct management teams dedicated to the SoC business and non-SoC business; and\n(iv) provide CLP Holdings with increased flexibility to invest its cash resources, including the funds received from the share placement to CITIC Pacific completed in March 1997, and raise finance for projects undertaken in the non-SoC business.\"\n11.\nThe pre and post reorganisation corporate structure is illustrated by means of a chart which is unnecessary to reproduce here. In brief, Holdings is to acquire all of the non-SoC business from CLP with the exception of CLP's 49% interest in Hong Kong Pump Storage Development Company Limited (\"PSDC\"), an associated company of CLP at book value. CLP will retain its SoC business which will include its 40% interest in CAPCO and its investment in PSDC which has the right to use certain pump storage capacity of the Guangzhou Pump Storage Power Station until 2034. The existence of various agreements prevents PSDC from becoming a subsidiary of Holdings.\nOverseas shareholders\n12.\nClause 4 of the Scheme provides that where the directors of CLP are advised that the allotment and issue, or transfer, of Holdings' shares to a holder of Scheme Shares may be prohibited by any relevant law or so prohibited except after compliance with conditions regarded by the directors of Holdings or CLP regarded as unduly onerous, then such shares in Holdings are to be sold and the net proceeds accounted for to the holder of Scheme Shares in full satisfaction of his rights to Holdings' shares which he would otherwise have become entitled under the Scheme. So, where such advice is received in relation to any particular overseas jurisdiction, the shareholders resident there will be forced to have their shares in Holdings sold. Although it may be open to shareholders whose shares are compulsorily sold to immediately repurchase Holdings' shares with the net proceeds, such a course may have limited appeal at this particular juncture, given the financial crisis affecting Southeast Asia in particular and the volatility of the stock market world-wide. Moreover the transaction costs will have to be borne by these shareholders.\n13.\nThere is evidence that as at 19 September 1997, CLP had shareholders resident in 25 overseas jurisdictions. Advice was not obtained from jurisdictions in respect of every jurisdiction in which the shareholders were resident. The jurisdictions deemed material were Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and U.S.A., a determination made by the directors of CLP by reference both to the aggregate number of shareholders resident in them and in terms of the perceived level of development of the local securities regulatory framework. Advice was obtained from foreign legal counsel in those material foreign jurisdictions as to whether the allotment of Holdings' shares to shareholders in CLP would require any specific compliance with relevant securities laws or regulations. Having regard to advice taken which is summarized in the affirmation of John Stirling Gale dated 31 December 1997, the net effect is that no overseas shareholder will in fact be affected by Clause 4 of the Scheme. Accordingly, no question arises as to the fairness of the Scheme\nvis-à-vis\noverseas shareholders.\n14.\nIn the course of his submissions, Mr Sykes, Q.C. for CLP, referred to Clause 4 as being for the protection of CLP rather than its shareholders; that it is legitimate protection for a company issuing shares having shareholders in overseas jurisdictions. Even if that be so, it does not follow that the Court is precluded from considering the impact of the provision on overseas shareholders in assessing the overall fairness of the Scheme.\n15.\nSince, in the events that have happened, no overseas shareholders will in fact be affected by Clause 4, because no advice has been received by the directors of Holdings or CLP as provided in that clause, no issue now arises from the operation of Clause 4. Any question that might have arisen has been rendered academic.\nClause 10 of the Scheme\n16.\nIt reads as follows -\n\"10. CLP Holdings shall, prior to the Effective Date, present a petition to the Court for confirmation of the reduction of its share premium account referred to in paragraph (F) of this Scheme pursuant to section 59 of the Companies Ordinance and the holders of CLP Holdings Shares allotted and issued, or transferred, pursuant to Clause 3 of this Scheme shall be deemed, for themselves and their successors in title in relation to such CLP Holdings Shares, to have approved and consented to such reduction of the share premium account of CLP Holdings.\"\nThe presentation of the Second Petition is thus made an integral part of the Scheme. Moreover, CLP shareholders on becoming holders of Holdings' shares pursuant to the Scheme are deemed to have consented to the reduction of Holdings' share premium account.\n17.\nThis provision is the unusual feature of the Scheme. Its\nraison d'etre\nis to address the two technical problems which arise as a result of the creation of a holding company.\n18.\nFirst, the effect of section 48B(2) of Cap.32 is that Holdings is required to create a share premium account because of its acquisition of the issued share capital of CLP under the Scheme. Section 48B(2) reads :\n\" (2) Where shares are issued for a consideration other than cash and the value of the consideration, as estimated by the directors having regard to all relevant information, is in excess of the amount credited as paid up on the shares so issued, the shares shall be deemed to have been issued at a premium equal to the difference between the value so estimated and the amount credited as paid up on the shares so issued.\"\n19.\nThe share premium is the difference between the market value of CLP shares in issue on the Effective Date less the aggregate nominal value of Holdings' shares issued to CLP shareholders under the Scheme. Based on the market value of CLP shares at the close of business on 2 January 1998, the share premium account is of the order of $92 billion. In fact their market value as at 5 January, the day before the Effective Date (at $41.60 per share) was a little less and the share premium account upon the Scheme taking effect came to $91,072,512,000.\n20.\nThe existence of a large share premium account will create a very unsatisfactory consolidated balance sheet for Holdings because of \"goodwill\" arising on consolidation. This is the excess of the value of CLP shares over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired. See\nRe Lippo China Resources Limited\n, 1997, MP 4195 at pp.7-9.\n21.\nIn its balance sheet, Holdings' investment in CLP will have to reflect the market value of the CLP shares. At $41.60 per share, their market value is just over $103.5 billion. As at 30 September 1997, the audited consolidated shareholders' funds of the CLP Group came to $39.297 billion. Between that date and 5 January 1998 (the date preceding the Effective Date), it is estimated that profits of $1.6 billion will have been generated. Therefore, as at the Effective Date, the consolidated shareholders' funds will amount to $40.897 billion. The difference between Holdings' original investment in CLP of approximately $103.5 billion and CLP's net assets represents goodwill on consolidation. Thus the goodwill arising will be approximately $62.6 billion.\n22.\nOne of the purposes of the Second Petition is to eliminate the value of the goodwill so arising against the share premium account of Holdings. As to the practice of eliminating goodwill arising on consolidation, see\nRe Ratners Group plc\n(1988) BCC 293 at 294 and\nRe Lippo China Resources Limited\n(\nsupra\n) at pp.7-9.\n23.\nSecond, Holdings will not be able to treat the profits earned by CLP prior to the acquisition by Holdings as available for distribution by way of dividends to Holdings' shareholders. This is the effect of para.18 of Schedule 10 to Cap.32. The relevant provisions read -\n\"18.(4) Where group accounts are not submitted, there shall be annexed to the balance sheet a statement showing -\n(a) ......\n(b) the net aggregate amount, so far as it concerns members of the holding company and is not dealt with in the company's accounts, of the subsidiaries' profits after deducting the subsidiaries' losses (or vice versa) -\n(i) for the respective financial years of the subsidiaries ending with or during the financial year of the company; and\n(ii) for their previous financial years since they respectively became the holding company's subsidiary;\n(c) the net aggregate amount of the subsidiaries' profits after deducting the subsidiaries' losses (or vice versa) -\n(i) for the respective financial years of the subsidiaries ending with or during the financial year of the company; and\n(ii) for their other financial years since they respectively became the holding company's subsidiary;\nso far as those profits are dealt with, or provision is made for those losses, in the company's accounts;\n(d) ..........\nor, in so far as the information required by this sub-paragraph is not obtainable, a statement that it is not obtainable:\nProvided that the Financial Secretary may, on the application or with the consent of the company's directors, direct that in relation to any subsidiary this sub-paragraph shall not apply or shall apply only to such extent as may be provided by the direction.\n(5) Sub-paragraph (4)(b) and (c) shall apply only to profits and losses of a subsidiary which may properly be treated in the holding company's account as revenue profits or losses, and the profits or losses attributable to any shares in a subsidiary for the time being held by the holding company or any other of its subsidiaries shall not (for that or any other purpose) be treated as aforesaid so far as they are profits or losses for the period before the date on or as from which the shares were acquired by the company or any of its subsidiaries, except that they may in a proper case be so treated where -\n(a) the company is itself the subsidiary of another body corporate; and\n(b) the shares were acquired from that body corporate or a subsidiary of it;\nand for the purpose of determining whether any profits or losses are to be treated as profits or losses for the said period the profit or loss for any financial year of the subsidiary may, if it is not practicable to apportion it with reasonable accuracy by reference to the facts, be treated as accruing from day to day during that year and be apportioned accordingly.\"\n24.\nEnglish provisions parallel to those of section 48B and para.18(5) of the 10th Schedule to Cap.32 have been held to have that effect. See\nShearer v. Bercain Ltd.\n[1980] 3 All ER 295. On the effect of section 56(1) of the\nCompanies Act 1948\n, being the English counterpart to section 48B(2), Walton J. held (at 311b) -\n\"... on its face s 56(1) clearly envisages a premium arising on an issue of shares otherwise than for cash. In general, it is the duty of the directors to issue shares in their company for the best equivalent they can obtain, and in a very large number of cases that will mean that they will be able to issue them at a premium, and consequently must do so. The amount of the premium must therefore in all cases be a matter of interest and concern to the directors. That being so, there can be no possible ground for the legislature having made such a ludicrous and totally unworkable distinction between cases where there is a stated and cases where there is no stated premium, and distinct from the factual position whether shares have or have not actually been issued at a premium.\"\nThe learned judge summarised the effect in these words (at 311e-f) :\n\"... Shortly put, whatever is purchased with capital in the shape of shares itself, or an equivalent amount, is itself to be treated as capital. That is the intent of s 56, and, in my judgment, it achieves that end.\"\n25.\nThen in dealing with the English counterpart to para.18(5) of the 10th Schedule, the learned Judge remarked (at 311j-312a) -\n\" There is, however, yet another provision in the 1948 Act, somewhat like the celebrated (but apocryphal) provision regarding the marriage of the Town Clerk of Leeds, tucked away in para 15 of Sch 8 to the 1948 Act. Schedule 8 is dealing with accounts, and para 15 is in Part II of the schedule, dealing with the position where the company is a holding or subsidiary company.\"\nAfter setting out the relevant provisions, the learned Judge went on to hold (at 312e-j) :\n\" The question here is simply: are the words 'for ... any other purpose' completely general, or are they limited in some, and if so what, manner? ... [Counsel for the Crown] suggested that 'for ... any other purpose' meant 'for any other purpose in the accounts of the holding company'. Moreover, he submitted that all that sub-para (5) provided was that the profits in question were not to be treated as revenue profits. Be that so: they were still profits, which the company was free to distribute as it thought fit. Finally he submitted that no consistent purpose was to be discerned in those two sub-paragraphs of Sch 8, and that there was no corresponding provision in para 17 of the same schedule.\nTo this last point counsel as amicus curiae retorted unanswerably that para 17 was dealing with consolidated accounts, and that the place to which one had to look to discover whether or not sums were distributable by way of dividend was the holding company's own accounts. He also said that whether the Board of Trade had power to amend Sch 8 or not was immaterial; it had to be construed as it stood. Counsel as amicus curiae further submitted that, although this was indeed an odd place to find a general provision of this nature, there was no doubt at all as to what it did, in terms, provide; and that it cannot possibly have been intended to leave the pre-acquisition profits available for distribution as dividend. What would be the point of a provision which merely robbed them of their character of revenue profits? What conceivable purpose could it serve?\nI agree with counsel as amicus curiae. The words 'for ... any other purpose' are quite general, and I cannot see how they can be confined in any manner to the purposes of the holding company's accounts. I cannot myself envisage anything in particular to which that could refer.\"\n27.\nMr Sykes Q.C. said that these problems were so fundamental that the law was changed not only in England but also in other jurisdictions such as Singapore and New Zealand. But in Hong Kong the law has not been changed.\n28.\nThe problems set out above can be resolved by the reduction of the share premium account. In addition, it will enable Holdings to write off preliminary expenses and the expenses of the Scheme. Whilst capital duty which is a significant proportion of the estimated costs of the Scheme of $370 million can be written off against the share premium account pursuant to section 48B(3)(b)(ii), the balance cannot and will have to be treated as realised losses and must be covered by distributable profits before Holdings can pay a dividend.\n29.\nAs regards the reduction of the share premium account, it is proposed that it be reduced to an amount equivalent to CLP's stated share premium account of $13.708 billion less an amount equivalent to the expenses of the Scheme and other preliminary expenses. The amount becoming available upon such reduction is to be applied :\n(i) to eliminate goodwill on consolidation by writing down the investment of Holdings in CLP so that it is, so far as possible, equal to the book value of the consolidated net assets of CLP as at the Effect Date;\n(ii) to write off the expenses of the Scheme and other preliminary expenses; and\n(iii) to make available the balance as distributable reserves of Holdings.\nThis is set out in the Chairman's letter, the explanatory statement as well as Recital (F) to the Scheme.\n30.\nThe objective, assuming that the reduction of the share premium account is confirmed, is to replicate a balance sheet for Holdings that is substantially the same as that for CLP immediately prior to the Effective Date. Set out below is the pro forma balance sheet for Holdings, using updated figures available at the hearing of the Second Petition :\nHOLDINGS\nPro forma balance sheet\nHK$m\nCapital Employed\nInvestment in subsidiary\n- initial value\n103,514\n- write down\n(62,617)\n40,897\nCurrent assets\n- cash at bank\n325\nCurrent liabilities\n- due to Companies Registry\n(273)\n- due to CLP for costs\n(27)\n(300)\n- due to Belleterre\n(370)\n(670)\n40,552\n======\nShare capital\n12,442\nShare premium\n13,363\nReserves\n- from reduction\n77,709\n- costs expended\n(45)\n- costs accrued\n(300)\n- write down investment in CLP\n(62,617)\n14,747\n40,552\n======\n(Belleterre mentioned above is a company incorporated in the BVI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CLP which advanced $370 million to Holdings on 24 December 1997 principally to cover the capital duty liabilities of Holdings under the Scheme.)\n31.\nWith such a balance sheet for Holdings, the position of CLP immediately before the Scheme and the position of Holdings immediately after the Scheme may be summarised as follows :\nCLP\nHOLDINGS\nShareholders funds @30.9.97\n39,297\n-\nUndistributed profits to 5.1.98\n1,600\n-\nShareholders funds @6.1.98\n40,897\n======\n40,552\n======\nRepresented by\nShare capital\n12,442\n12,442\nShare premium\n13,708\n13,363\nReserves\n@30.9.97\n13,147\nplus to 5.1.98\n1,600\n14,747\n14,747\n40,897\n======\n40,552\n======\nThe Court's functions\nA. Schemes of arrangement\n32.\nThe Court is invited to sanction the Scheme. In\nRe Dorman, Long & Company, Limited\n[1934] Ch.635 Maugham J. held (at p.655) that -\n\"It is plain that the duties of the court are two-fold. The first is to see that the resolutions are passed by the statutory majority in value and number ... at a meeting or meetings duly convened and held. The other duty is in the nature of a discretionary power ...\"\nHe went on to say (at p.657) as follows -\n\"In my opinion, then, so far as the second duty is concerned what I have to see is whether the proposal is such that an intelligent and honest man, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve.\"\n(1) Compliance with statutory requirements\n33.\nAs regards the first ground, there appears to be four separate considerations, namely :\n(i) the classes of members or creditors must be properly constituted;\n(ii) the meetings were duly convened in accordance with the directions given by the court hearing the originating summons;\n(iii) members or creditors have been given a sufficient explanation of the Scheme and its effects and sufficient information to enable them to make a reasonable judgment as to how to vote at the meeting; and\n(iv) the requisite majority (i.e. a simple majority in number representing three quarters in value of those present and voting in person or by proxy at the meeting) has voted in favour of the Scheme.\nSee generally\nBoyle and Marshall on Practice and Procedure of the Companies Court\n(1997 Edn.) at 3.6.6.\n34.\nIn the present case, no issue arises as to the correct composition of the classes of members or creditors since only members holding CLP ordinary shares of $5 each are involved. There is evidence that the requisite meeting was duly convened and passed by the requisite majority.\n35.\nSo far as the third consideration is concerned, \"the extent and quality of the information required to be supplied depends on the facts of each particular case.\" See\nRe Heron International N.V.\n[1994] 1 BCLC 667 at 672i.\n36.\nIn the present case, pared to its essentials, the two Petitions are designed to interpose a holding company which will have a balance sheet akin to that of CLP immediately prior to the implementation of the Scheme. The costs of the Scheme which are not insignificant (estimated to be $370 million) are to be paid out of monies otherwise forming part of distributable reserves. Put shortly, the shareholders are asked to bear the cost of the exercise, since the distributable reserves of Holdings will be less than the distributable reserves of CLP prior to the Group reorganisation, the difference being the expenses of the Scheme and the preliminary expenses. Those matters form the guts of the Scheme.\n37.\nConsent must mean \"informed\" consent. Implicit in this is that all material information be disclosed to the shareholders. The amount of costs attributable to each share or the estimated costs is plainly material information.\n38.\nIt is said that the costs are\nde minimis\n. But whether they are to be so regarded must be a matter for the shareholders who, after all, are to foot the bill for the reorganisation, the ostensible benefit being of a rather intangible kind, namely, the rationalisation of CLP's businesses. Only they are qualified to pass judgment on whether the costs involved, amounting to 10% of the aggregate dividends declared by CLP for the year ended 30 September 1997, are inconsequential.\n39.\nNeither the explanatory statement nor the Scheme itself contained any information about expenses other than that they will be Holdings' liability to be written off against the share premium account. Only in the Chairman's letter is there any reference to the estimated costs of the Scheme (i.e. $370 million) \"equivalent to approximately $0.15 per CLP share\". Had the explanatory statement also contained this information, the costs to be borne by each share would undoubtedly have been more effectively brought home to the shareholders. I say this because the composite document (\"the Circular\") circulated to shareholders, similar to prospectuses and the like may be described as \"heavy\" reading and not readily comprehensible to the uninitiated. Regrettably they are usually notable for length, verbosity and obfuscation rather than for brevity and clarity. The single reference to estimated costs lies buried in the Circular, the English version of which runs to almost 140 pages.\n40.\nThe estimated expenses of $370 million include $49 million which, at the hearing on 5 January, was represented as being the aggregate amount of professional fees but in respect of which no breakdown was provided. Leading counsel submitted that it is not appropriate for the Court to second guess the reasonableness or otherwise of the fees incurred. It was further urged that the duty of scrutinising the reasonableness or otherwise of the level of fees falls upon the directors. But it is not a question of any second guessing on the part of the Court : rather, that information ought to be provided to the shareholders who are paying for the exercise. In my judgment, it is information that would assist a shareholder in determining whether, in the light of all relevant information, to give or withhold his consent. Moreover, it is precisely the absence of any mechanism for independent scrutiny and challenge (such as the taxation procedure) that makes full disclosure so much more important. It would have been different had the directors sought to obtain a general mandate from the shareholders to be the sole arbiters of what fees are reasonable and to incur such fees as they deem appropriate for the purposes of the reorganisation.\n41.\nThere is another respect in which the treatment of costs in the Circular requires comment. At the hearing of the First Petition, the Court's attention was not drawn to the fact that a significant part of the $49 million of fees was a contingency provision. At the hearing of the Second Petition a week later, when the final figures became available, the Court sought an explanation for the apparent decrease in costs from $370 million to $345 million, $3 million of which was attributable to the lower share price. It then emerged that the $49 million included a significant contingency and that this was referred to in the affirmation of Mr Dickson Leach dated 30 December 1997 filed in the Second Petition. As noted above, this was not referred to at the hearing of the First Petition notwithstanding queries raised as to the breakdown of the $49 million.\n42.\nAccording to paragraph 8 of the affirmation, fees as at 30 December were estimated to be $27 million. If so, the contingency would be $22 million. At the hearing of the Second Petition, the Court was provided with a summary showing the amounts forecast and actual liabilities. It showed a contingency of $27 million, estimated fees as at 30 December at $22 million, with actual fees being $27 million. In the light of Mr Dickson Leach's affirmation, it would appear that contrary to what the Court was told by leading counsel on instructions that the fees had increased by $5 million from $22 million to $27 million or 22% in the interim, the more likely scenario is that the entries under the forecast column for \"Fees\" and \"Contingency\" in the summary were erroneously transposed and that there was no change in the amount of fees during that 2 week period.\n43.\nBe that as it may, all this merely reinforces the need for transparency and full disclosure of material information, a practice that can only be salutary. In my judgment, the Circular ought to have disclosed both the fact and the amount of the contingency.\n44.\nWhilst CLP's approach to the costs issue is wrong and there are deficiencies in disclosure in the Circular, in all the circumstances, they are not so fundamental as to justify the withholding of the Court's sanction. The shareholders have not been misled although the information supplied to them left something to be desired. I hasten to add that this should not be taken by future applicants as an invitation to be economic with material information. They do so at their peril.\n(2) Overall merits\n45.\nAs regards the second ground, the initial onus is upon the Applicant to establish the fairness of the Scheme. Much emphasis was put on the fact that it received strong voting support, a fact which may be thought sufficient to raise a strong inference of fairness. Gower has observed with characteristic perspicacity that \"the court cannot readily investigate the indoor management of the company and therefore it tends to take refuge in the facile but fatal rule that\ncreditors or shareholders know best.\" The rule has its origins in\nRe English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank\n(1893) 3 Ch.385 where Lindley L.J. held (at 409) :\n\"If the creditors are acting on sufficient information and with time to consider what they are about, and are acting honestly, they are, I apprehend, much better judges of what is to their commercial advantage than the court can be.\"\nAs Gower noted, the rule \"is based on the fundamentally false assumption that a vote of a meeting necessarily represents the informed opinion of the majority of members of the class concerned unprejudiced by any conflicting interests.\" See\nGower's Principles of Company Law\n4th Edn. at 712-3.\n46.\nBut no question of conflicting interests arises in the present case. Therefore, applying the test laid down in\nRe Dorman, Long\n(\nsupra\n), I am satisfied that the proposal is such that \"an intelligent and honest man ... acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve\". Accordingly, it is appropriate to sanction the Scheme.\nB. Reductions of capital\n47.\nThe applicable principles are set out in my decision in\nRe Lippo China Resources Ltd.\n1997, MP 4195 where the relevant English authorities are reviewed. They are that -\n(i) the shareholders are treated equitably;\n(ii) the reduction proposals are properly explained in the Circular;\n(iii) creditors are safeguarded; and\n(iv) the reduction is for a discernible purpose.\nEach of the four requirements being satisfied, there is therefore no reason not to confirm the reduction of capital which the Scheme involves.\nThe Second Petition\n48.\nSince this also involves a reduction of capital, the principles set out above apply. So far as creditor protection is concerned, Holdings which was only recently incorporated, has no liabilities except liabilities for capital duty and for expenses. The expenses are owed to CLP. As noted above, Belleterre has advanced $370 million to Holdings principally to enable Holdings to discharge its capital duty liabilities. Both Belleterre and CLP have consented to the proposed reduction of Holdings' share premium account and for that purpose, they have agreed to postpone their respective debts. So the only creditor that needs to be protected is the Company Registry for capital duty. For this purpose, an undertaking was given at the stage of the Order on the summons for directions that if a dividend is declared before the Company Registry's debt is discharged, the dividend is to be paid out of funds other than those representing the advance from Belleterre and deposited with the Hongkong Bank.\n49.\nAs to the need for the \"usual full undertaking\" or the\nGrosvenor\ntype of undertaking (considered in\nRe Lippo China Resources Ltd.\nat pp.4-7), I am satisfied that it is not appropriate since there is but one creditor and there is more than sufficient cash to cover that liability.\n50.\nThat the proposed reduction is for a discernible purpose has plainly been established and I need to say no more about this.\n51.\nFor those reasons, it is appropriate to confirm the reduction of the share premium account.\n(Doreen Le Pichon)\nJudge of the Court of First Instance\nHigh Court\nRepresentation:\nMr Richard Sykes, Q.C. leading Mr Winston Poon, S.C., inst'd by M/s Stephenson Harwood & Lo, for CLP Company Limited (MP 3825/97)\nMr Winston Poon, S.C., inst'd by M/s Stephenson Harwood & Lo, for CLP Holdings Limited (MP4519/97)", "word_count": 6084, "language": "en", "cited_cases": [], "source_url": "https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_body.jsp?DIS=17627&QS=%2B&TP=JU", "pdf_url": null, "scraped_at": "2026-01-03T11:19:19.650746"}
